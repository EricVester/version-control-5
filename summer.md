<b>What did we do in the summer?</b><br>

<b>Hunter Durbin:</b><br>
Over the summer, I worked in a factory and pretty much moved wood all day. 
Then I went home to eat and sleep. 
Finally, I woke up and repeated that process :/<br><br>

<b>Kaleb Matchett:</b><br>
During the summer, I worked in a basement at Ball State's Speech Pathology Clinic.
I enjoyed spending time with friends and family alike. I even saw my grandparents
for the first time in more than a decade!
